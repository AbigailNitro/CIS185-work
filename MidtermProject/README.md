        ## 0. Apology
        Sorry about the general roughness of all this, sickness + ADHD
        is NOT a good combo

        ## 1. Project Description
        This is a wiki of an ARG project, Salvage labs. The main purpose is to
        act as a written archive of story content.

        ## 2. Target Audience
        New and old fans of Salvage Labs, so they can get caught up or review lore 

        ## 3. Main Features
        landing page with basic synopsis, character type pages, pages for individual characters (WIP)

        ## 4. Technologies Used
        html-basic structure, css for grid system/slideshows, js for slideshows

        ## 5. File Structure
        Since theres a lot of pages here, I had to use folders to keep it compact. I used
        capital letters for the folders to keep it seperate from the files. as for the overall
        structure i figured leaving the styles closer to the root would make it easier since i
        can just move up 1-2 folders in my filepath 

        ## 6. Challenges Faced
        getting the grid system for the character cards took a minute, specifically
        with getting the empty space, as my unusual formatting kept making it a 
        large box rather than a rectangle. mainly caused by a minor error in the css

        ## 7. AI Tools Used
        I used chatGPT one time to check a problem i was having with the grid box, turns out
        I messed up on the quotes, thats it.

        ## 8. Future Improvements
        Finish all the character pages.
