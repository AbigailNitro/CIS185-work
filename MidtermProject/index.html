                <br> <br>
                <p>the most versatile of the story, the robots have full bodies that allow them to roam the Nevada lab. their heights vary but theyre typically tall, and possess decent strength</p>

                <br> <br>
                <p>Mainly cosisting of the original 9 ais made by salvage labs, computers are ais living within computers, each with their own personality, and appearance. what differs them from robots is their notable lack of body.</p>

                <br> <br>
                <p>WHile the story focuses on ais, there are still humans in this story, all of them integral to each ai's backstory, motive, and current plot relevance.</p>
